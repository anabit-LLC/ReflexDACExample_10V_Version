# ReflexDACExample_10V_Version
This example Arduino sketch is meant to work with Anabit's Reflex DAC 14 Bit 2MSPS bipolar output +/- 10.0V open source reference design This example sketch demonstrates how to output 4 different voltage waveform patterns from the 14 bit DAC. This portable version targets ANY Arduino board with hardware SPI.
